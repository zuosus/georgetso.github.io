Of course I have websites built with wordpress for my friend's law firm, or by other tools. This is the first website that I build from scratch by coding. I have worked on Node.js for BFF and React.js for Mobile but never for websites.

It's a new exploration to me as websites are so different than backend service or mobile apps, but I do like it and hope to get more familiar.

last but not least, Cloudflare is the GOAT! LOVE IT!
