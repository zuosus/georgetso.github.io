Of course I have websites built with wordpress for my friend's law firm, or by other tools. This is the first website that I build from scratch by coding. I have worked on Node.js for BFF and React.js for Mobile but never for websites.

Building a website from scratch is a different experience from backend services or mobile apps. It's a new area to get familiar with.

Cloudflare has been a great platform for this project.
