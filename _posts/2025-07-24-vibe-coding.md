title: "Vibe Coding with AI: A Pleasant Surprise"

Recently, our company invested in some AI services. While they've been generally good, I find myself nodding along with DHH's perspective: AI is fantastic as a learning tool, but when you let it handle tasks directly, you often end up cleaning up after it.

That's been my experience too, until today.

I tried vibe coding with Claude Sonnet, and I have to say - while not perfect, it's surprisingly good. The experience was notably different from my previous AI interactions. The code flow felt more natural, and the back-and-forth was actually productive.

It's fascinating to think about how even "weak AI" like these generative models are already freeing us from many constraints. We're witnessing how technology genuinely transforms our daily work life. Sure, we're not at AGI yet, but these tools are already making a real difference.

Looking back at the rapid progress in just the past year, I can't help but feel optimistic about where this is heading. Technology isn't just changing our lives - it's evolving how we think about work itself.
