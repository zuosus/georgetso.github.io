Recently, our company invested in some AI services. While they've been generally good, I agree with DHH's perspective: AI is a good learning tool, but when you let it handle tasks directly, you often end up cleaning up after it.

That's been my experience as well, until today.

I tried vibe coding with Claude Sonnet, and while not perfect, it's surprisingly good. The experience was different from my previous AI interactions. The code flow felt more natural, and the back-and-forth was productive.

Even "weak AI" like these generative models are already freeing us from many constraints. Technology is transforming our daily work life. While not at AGI yet, but these tools are already making a real difference.

The rapid progress in just the past year is promising. Technology isn't just changing our lives - it's evolving how we think about work itself.
