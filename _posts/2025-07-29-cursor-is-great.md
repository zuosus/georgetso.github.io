Today I used Cursor membership for several coding tasks, and the experience was good. Not only did it help me complete jobs efficiently, but it even identified a missing component in my previous work that I'd overlooked.

This experience shows that AI coding assistants won't replace engineers. Instead, they'll become essential tools that amplify our capabilities. The key insight? Those without fundamental coding knowledge can't effectively guide AI to produce optimal solutions. Understanding programming concepts remains crucial to:

- Formulating precise prompts
- Evaluating AI-generated solutions
- Troubleshooting edge cases
- Maintaining code quality

While Cursor is powerful, it still requires human direction and expertise. Engineers who can effectively collaborate with AI will be more successful, not those who avoid learning core programming skills.
