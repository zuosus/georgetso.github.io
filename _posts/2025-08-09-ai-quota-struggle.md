title: "AI Quota Disparity: GPT-5 vs DeepSeek"

Here is my recent experience with OpenAI's GPT-5.

I was ready to test the model. I could only ask 7 questions before hitting the quota limit.

With DeepSeek, on the other hand, there is no such issue. With DeepSeek, I can ask many questions and use features like Reasoning mode and Web Search.

The difference in quota between GPT-5 and DeepSeek is significant.

OpenAI's quota system might be about creating artificial scarcity, while DeepSeek's approach is more generous.

This shows that more advanced technology can have more restrictions, and generosity and accessibility are important features.
