title: "Finally Recovered All Investment Losses - Mostly Due to Luck"

After several years of ups and downs, I have finally recovered all my previous investment losses on paper. Looking back, I have to be honest about what really happened - it was mostly luck, at least in my case.

## 2020: The Beginning - Loss of $3,700

In 2020, when I first started investing, I had no clue what I was doing. I made countless mistakes that beginners often make: chasing high prices, panic selling, emotion-driven trading, and having no clear investment strategy. That year, I lost about $3,700.

I thought I could learn from this, but honestly, there wasn't much to learn beyond "don't lose more money than you can afford."

## 2021: The Setback - Even Bigger Loss of $25,300

In 2021, I continued trading with the same limited knowledge. I tried to read a few books and watch some videos about investing, but I was still essentially gambling. More losses followed, and by the end of the year, I had lost approximately $25,300.

This period taught me that having a little knowledge can be dangerous, as it makes you overconfident. I was still just making random bets, but now I felt justified about it.

## 2025: The Lucky Turn - Profit of About $30,000

In 2025, something changed. Not because I had become a better investor, but because I happened to be in the right positions at the right time. My $30,000 in profits came not from superior strategy or discipline, but from being lucky when it mattered.

## The Honest Truth About Trading

Looking back at these years, I have to be honest: most of trading success is just being lucky. You can study all the charts and theories you want, but the market is largely unpredictable. Some people will disagree, but my experience clearly shows that my recovery came from luck, not from learning from my earlier mistakes.

Maybe I just got lucky in the end, but at least I'm back to even now - on paper, at least.
