title: "The Reality of AI Coding Assistants: Great Potential, Inconsistent Execution"

Over the past few weeks, I've been experimenting with various AI coding assistants including Qwen, Gemini, Cursor, and Claude Code. My experience has been a mix of pleasant surprises and frustrating setbacks - a rollercoaster that's left me both impressed and disappointed.

## The Good: Incredible Efficiency Boost

When these tools work well, they're truly remarkable. I've seen them:

- Generate entire component files from simple descriptions
- Refactor complex code blocks with perfect accuracy
- Suggest optimizations I wouldn't have thought of
- Explain intricate concepts in accessible terms

There are moments when the AI seems to read my mind, producing exactly what I need before I even finish formulating the request. These instances make me genuinely excited about the future of software development.

## The Frustrating: Breaking What Already Works

However, the excitement is often short-lived. More times than I'd like to admit, I've encountered these issues:

- The AI breaks existing functionality while trying to implement new features
- It repeatedly makes the same mistakes even after I point them out
- It gets stuck in loops trying to fix simple issues without identifying the root cause
- It confidently provides solutions that look correct but fail in subtle ways

What's particularly frustrating is the cycle: I ask the AI to generate something, it breaks existing code, I ask it to fix the breakage, it introduces new issues, and the cycle continues. It's like having a very smart but overly eager junior developer who needs constant supervision.

## The Paradox: Powerful Yet Limited

These tools demonstrate incredible sophistication in some areas while surprisingly failing at basic tasks in others. They can architect complex systems but stumble on simple syntax errors. They understand high-level concepts but miss implementation details that are obvious to any experienced developer.

## The Verdict: Worth Trying, But Manage Expectations

Despite the inconsistencies, I still believe these tools are worth exploring. They offer genuine productivity gains when they work correctly. However, they're not the sophisticated, reliable partners we might hope for yet.

My current recommendation:
- Use them for brainstorming and initial implementation
- Always review and test their output thoroughly
- Don't rely on them for critical or complex systems without extensive validation
- Remember that they're assistants, not replacements - your expertise is still essential

The technology is clearly heading in the right direction, but we're not there yet. We're in the early adopter phase where the benefits are real but require significant human oversight to be truly useful.
